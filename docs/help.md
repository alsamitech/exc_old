#Extended C libraries help
this is the docs folder. this is where all the documentation is stored for the Extended C libraries.
For beginners, it is reccomended that you use the **standard** edition of these libraries. Those include most of the essential functions that the C standard library does not incude by default.

Application formatting
```cpp
//Put #include "exc.h" before ANYTHING else. it already comtains stdio.h so no need to worry about that.
int main() {
  //Do code here
}
```
